The locations neighbors currently do work by reference, but the items and npcs do not
	so items and npcs are duplicated when added to locations
	because you can't make a vector of references

Is that how we want it to work?



I think I want to extract the player data from the Game class into it's own Player class
Then I can add money to the player and shops to the npcs,
then maybe I can also add mana to player and spells (would be like items)



Alos probably remove the GameLogic namespace later
	I thought it was a good idea but probably not
	I'll keep an eye on it
